This application takes in a new user's responses to survey 
questions and compares them to those of other users (employees). 
The application then evaluates which of the other users already
in the database most closely match the responses of the new user,
then displays the matched user's profile to the new user.

This application can be useful in finding compaitiblity 
matches within organizations between employees for project
work, travel arrangements or mentor/mentee relationships.

A new can answer a few questions, to find his/her employee
compaitiblity match.
