# EmployeeFinder

In this app, a user must enter his/her name and a link to a profile picture (link can be jibberish, but not blank) before answering a 10-question survey.

After answering the survey questions, the app calculates the user's answers and compares them to answers by other users in the database.

The app then displays the name and picture of the other user whose survey answers most closely match those of the current user.
